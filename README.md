# Hotspot Analysis and Spatial Modeling of Deaths using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR)

This project in R focuses on analyzing spatial patterns and modeling the number of deaths using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR). GWR is a spatial statistical technique that allows for the exploration of spatially varying relationships between variables.

## Introduction

Spatial analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the distribution and clustering of various phenomena, including mortality rates. This project aims to identify hotspots of mortality and model the relationship between mortality rates and contributing factors using Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR) in R. By considering spatial variation, GWR provides insights into how the relationships between variables vary across space.

## Features

- **Hotspot Analysis**: Identify spatial clusters or hotspots of high or low mortality rates.
- **Geographic Weighted Regression (GWR)**: Model the relationship between mortality rates and contributing factors while accounting for spatial variation.
- **Visualization**: Visualize spatial patterns of mortality rates and GWR results using maps and plots.
